//// Argon2 is the winner of the [Password Hashing Competition (PHC)](https://password-hashing.net).
////
//// Argon2 is a memory-hard password hashing function which can be used to hash
//// passwords for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
////
//// Argon2 has the following three variants (Argon2id is the default):
////
//// - Argon2d - suitable for applications with no threats from side-channel
////   timing attacks (eg. cryptocurrencies)
//// - Argon2i - suitable for password hashing and password-based key derivation
//// - Argon2id - a hybrid of Argon2d and Argon2i
////
//// Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id are parametrized by:
////
//// - A **time** cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
////   therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
//// - A **memory** cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
//// - A **parallelism** degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
////
//// More information can be found at the [Argon2 reference C implementation
//// repository](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) and in the
//// documentation for the [elixir_argon2](https://hex.pm/packages/argon2_elixir)
//// package.
////
//// ## Comparison with Bcrypt / Pbkdf2
////
//// Argon2 has better password cracking resistance than Bcrypt and Pbkdf2.
//// Its main advantage is that, as it is a memory-hard function, it is designed
//// to withstand parallel attacks that use GPUs or other dedicated hardware.
